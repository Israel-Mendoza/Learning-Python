The content in the Pluralsight directory will be more scarce,
since I am only using that content to do some revision on what I have learned while going through the Udemy courses.

The code contains way more comments than necessary.
And this is because I tend to organize my repositories in such a way that the code is not only code, but also study material:
I just want to **grab my iPad, open the GitHub application and start reading the repo** as if was *refresher material*.
