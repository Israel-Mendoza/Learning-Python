# Learning Python

> This repository will hold most of the code I write while studying.
> I will try to add all of my notes and output of the code as comments for future reference.

The contents of the repository will be mainly advanced concepts, specially OOP and functional paradigns in Python.

However, there may be other folders with specifics I may feel it's relevant to study, so there may be a lot of unrelated topics.
