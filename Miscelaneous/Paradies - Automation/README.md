# Paradies LagardÃ¨re Automation scripts

> I keep these files, since they were my very first attempts to get my almost inexistant Python skills to work on something I could actually use at work
> While they may seem horrible, I hold them dearly. Be easy on them, should you ever take a look at them.
> I've improved ever since, I promise. Or at least I want to believe I've improved. :tada:
